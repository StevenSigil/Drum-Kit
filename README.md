# Drum-Kit
A drum kit web app you can play in your browser!

Drum-Kit is an application made during a web-dev bootcamp hosted by [The App Brewery](https://www.appbrewery.co/).  This app's purpose was to explore more advance javascript ideas than previously shown.  Namely, using the switch statement to alter elements in the DOM and their css styles.

You can view the app here: https://stevensigil.github.io/Drum-Kit/

*All assets were supplied by the instructor of the bootcamp and are intended for educational purposes only.*
